		<ol>
			<li>Contribute by sharing tweets that have struck your interest, amazed or surprised you.</li>
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>On Tweap.co, it is not required to have a Twitter account to share tweets.
					<br />
					You simply have to connect and contribute by submitting a tweet link, and voila!</li>
				<li>If you do not have a link to a tweet on hand, no problem, you can use the Targeted search functionality.
					<br />With this feature (icon), you are able to search tweets in specific Twitter accounts.
					<br />It is therefore possible to discover tweets from your favorite subject from any Twitter accounts, and add those that seem most interesting in our Boards.</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<li>Check out the most popular tweets and the latest trending tweets by accessing these two boards: Popular Board & Recent Board.</li>
<br />
			<ul>
				<li>By browsing on any of these boards, you have the power to:</li>
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>Popular Board: Raise the popularity of a tweet using the Spread feature.</li>
					<li>Recent Board: Share a trending tweet with other users using the Spread feature.</li>
				</ul>
			
			</ul>
			<br />
			<li>Quickly find tweets of interest through our search bar.</li>
			<br />
			<ul>

			<li>Be on the lookout for all tweets at any time of day or night!</li>
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Each tweet posted on Tweap.co has a lifetime of just one hour.
					<br />
					The more the tweet is Spread(ed) by users, the more the tweet sees its lifetime increased! An unpopular tweet 
					
					<ul>
